# CS 102 LABS
## Bilkent University 2021-2022 Spring Semester CS 102 labs

This repository functions both as a backup and a coding portfolio for me. Please feel free to explore. I have included each lab assignment too for people with studying purposes. Yet, some files here may not be the same as those I have submitted because of changes in the lab revision.

I do not wish to encourage other CS 102 students to cheat in labs. So, I will not upload the most recent lab assignments. **Please abide by the lab _honor code_**:
> You are allowed to reuse the codes given in your textbook and/or your lecture slides. However, you are not allowed to use any code from somewhere else (e.g., from the Internet, other textbooks or other slides).

***Have a nice day!!!***
